# Soteria
Woman Safety App to allow safer experience with informed decisions 

# Project Title: 
Soteria : Informed Decisions, Safer Experience

# Team members: 
Fenil Gala, Kushagra Govil, Aryan Jain, Aniket Mohanty, Tejas Yalamanchili

# Problem Statement: 
Through the past couple of years, there has been a marked increase in the number of sexual harassment cases occuring in different social venues across college campuses. Often, these occur when students have a lack of resources to make informed decisions about the social venues that they choose to visit. Using Soteria, users can get an accurate depiction of the safety of social venues across campuses using safety scores for venues to allow them to make informed decisions. Additionally, the heatmap feature will enable users to view areas near them where other users have felt unsafe.

# Project Objectives: 
Set up a mobile app review system for users to rate greek houses, bars, clubs and other social hangouts based on how safe they felt at the location
Create an interactive heatmap where users can see the above mentioned locations along with their respective user-derived safety ratings
Acquire campus safewalk location data to display the same on the map
Scrape Purdue’s Fraternity, Sorority, and Cooperative Semester report data to display on the app as reference
Set up user authentication to provide login functionality and allow users to create accounts to give reviews 
Implement a quick-access emergency SOS button to inform the appropriate authorities and trusted contacts of the location of the user in case of an emergency

# Stakeholders: 
Users -  Women concerned about their safety, well-being, and overall comfortability when visiting different social hangouts across campus.
